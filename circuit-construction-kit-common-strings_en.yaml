                     A Construction Area creates a building space for components added from a Circuit Component Toolbox. 
                     Build and navigate your circuits there. If Voltmeters and Ammeters are out of the toolbox, you can 
                     take measurements.
    controlArea:     >-
                     Voltmeters and Ammeters can be found in the Measurement Tools Toolbox. Display Options provide ways 
                     to add or remove information about components in the Construction Area. There's an option to choose 
                     between a Lifelike View or a Schematic View for circuit components, and you can Reset All to clear 
                     everything and start over.
